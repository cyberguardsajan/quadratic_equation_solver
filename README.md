# Quadratic Equation Solver

Quadratic Equation Solver is a simple Python program that solves quadratic equations of the form:

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

The program takes user input for the coefficients and calculates the roots of the equation based on the discriminant. It provides real solutions if they exist.

## Features

- **Solve Quadratic Equations:** Input values for `a`, `b`, and `c` to solve quadratic equations.
- **Handles All Cases:** 
  - Two real solutions for positive discriminants.
  - One real solution for zero discriminant.
  - No real solutions for negative discriminants.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cyberguardsajan/quadratic_equation_solver.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd quadratic_equation_solver
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python QuadraSolve.py
    ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Enter values for the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` when prompted.

3. The program will calculate and display the solutions or inform you if there are no real solutions.

## Example Output

```text
Enter the first coefficient (a): 1
Enter the second coefficient (b): -3
Enter the third coefficient (c): 2
The solutions of this equation are:
2.0
1.0
```

In this example, the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \) has two solutions: \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 1 \).



If the discriminant is negative, the program will output:

```text
No real solutions for this equation.
```
